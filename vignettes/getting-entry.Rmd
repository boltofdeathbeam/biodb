# Accessing database entries by accession number

In this vignette, we will explain how to download and access entry information from databases.

First you need to create an instance of the `Biodb` class:
```{r}
mybiodb <- biodb::Biodb$new()
```

Then you need to choose the database you want to access. For that you need to use a database ID in the form of a string. To get the list of available database IDs, just run:
```{r}
mybiodb$getDbsInfo()$getIds()
```

To obtain an entry from a database you have to call the `getEntry()` method from the `BiodbFactory` class. The following example access the KEGG database in order to retrieve the entry number 2:
```{r}
entry <- mybiodb$getFactory()$getEntry('kegg', id = 'C00005')
```

From an entry instance, you can access different values stored in fields. Here is an example to get back the entry number (or accession number) used to obtain this entry:
```{r}
entry$getFieldValue('accession')
```

We can have a list of all available fields for an entry:
```{r}
entry$getFieldNames()
```

You can also get a data frame of the field values with the method `getFieldsAsDataFrame()`:
```{r}
entry$getFieldsAsDataFrame()
```
